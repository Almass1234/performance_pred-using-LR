# 🎯 Performance Prediction using Logistic Regression

This project focuses on building a machine learning model using **Logistic Regression** to predict binary performance outcomes based on input features.

---

## 📌 Project Objectives

- Predict performance categories (e.g., pass/fail, efficient/inefficient) using logistic regression.
- Clean and preprocess data.
- Train and evaluate the model.
- Predict outcomes on new data.
